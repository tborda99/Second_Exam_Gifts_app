# second_exam_gifts_app
Object oriented programing in Python done for the second exam of my Programing course. <br>
The app handles lists of users and their wanted gifts. Each user has a list of gifts they would want to recieve. <br>
Gifts are either "Vestimenta" (Clothing), or "Libros" (Books). Both classes inherit from the parent class "producto" (product)<br>
The app handles errors, excpetions and is able to detect errors due to user input.<br>
- **app_lista_de_deseos.py** is the main. 
    - Create new users
    - Add products to a user's list
    - Register a gift
    - Obtain most gifted products
    - Obtain list of book lovers (people who want books and also give books).
